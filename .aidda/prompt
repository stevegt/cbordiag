show diagnostic output with annotations

We are writing a new tool to show diagnostic output with annotations.
The tool will be called `cbordiag` and will be used to parse and
display diagnostic information from CBOR (Concise Binary Object
Representation) data.  We can reference existing annotated diagnostic
parsers in Ruby and Rust for inspiration.

Next steps:  
- write a README.md with usage instructions for both CLI and library

Always return the complete file -- do not stub, summarize, or replace
code with comments

In: 
    cmd/cbordiag/main.go
    cbordiag.go
    cbordiag_test.go
Out: 
    README.md
